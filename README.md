# Personal Portfolio

## Overview

I previously made a static website with HTML and CSS to display my current work in photography, programming, and design. However, I wanted to elevate the site and showcase more of a skillset, so I migrated the site to React with plans to extend its functionality and take advantage of what react libraries have to offer. 

### *** Note: please check out the styling branch for the most recent code!

## Features
There are a few pages. 

–Landing: See basic info about me and my interests. You can also find my skillset here and some contact information. 

–Photos: Here I have a React carousel of some of my favorite photos!

–Projects: Check out some of my previous webdev and design projects. 

–Experience: Where I feature my previous internships and on-campus involvements. 

–Contact Me: Contact me. 

## What Worked Well

I feel confident in my knowledge of jsx and components, so it wasn't too much trouble setting those up. I also really enjoy styling, and took my time to make sure I really liked the final product I wanted. I also really enjoyed messing with packages like tsParticles and the timeline to better showcase my work history. 

## What Didn't

I had a bit of trouble deploying a vite app directly to pages, but once I found the documentation it was smooth sailing. A lot of photo carousel packages are also a bit buggy to implement, which was a frustrating part of the process. An ongoing issue is managing my photo library so it loads in faster. I think I will add smaller photo sizes in the future.

## Future Plans 

I am not sure yet, but as I learn more design techniques and webdev tricks, I expect to be updating this site somewhat frequently!
