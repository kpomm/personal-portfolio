# Portfolio -- In React!

I previously made a static website with HTML and CSS to display my current work in photography, programming, and design. However, I wanted to elevate the site and showcase more of a skillset, so I migrated the site to react with plans to extend its functionality and take advantage of what react libraries have to offer. 

## What Worked Well

I feel confident in my knowledge of jsx and components, so it wasn't too much trouble setting those up. I also really enjoy styling, and took my time to make sure I really liked the final product I wanted. 

## What Didn't

I had a bit of trouble deploying a vite app directly to pages, but once I found the documentation it was smooth sailing.
