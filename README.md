# SA 2: Starterpack --> SA 4: Routing

In SA2, our task was to build a 'starter package' for a website. As we start to make more complicated projects, this seems like a wonderful way to organize all the packages and plugins we plan to use. The npm run dev also updates automatically as we change things, which is super convenient. 

In SA4, our task was to set up routing on our starterpack.

## What Worked Well

I think the timer part worked pretty well! I had to look up the documentation for the interval method but once I understood it was very intuitive. I also thought I had a good grasp on how all the components fit together in the starter package. I also loved adding in the cute little cat(from unsplash)!

SA4: I think the set up was very intuitive. It felt like it made sense setting up the routes with components. 

## What Didn't

I had the hardest time with installing the favicon plugin. This was because I pasted the favicon plugin into the css plugins instead of the regular plugins section -- this caused me quite a bit of trouble. I also had to make a .node-version file and follow some instructions from the SA2 slack to get the vite-plugins-favicons-inject plugin to work on render. This was because I had to specify a node version for the build. The link to the tutorial is below:

SA4: I didn't have any issues with this assignment! 

## Extra Credit

For extra credit, I installed the vite-plugins-favicons-inject plugin and NVM. Proof is shown in the screenshots.
