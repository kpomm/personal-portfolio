# Portfolio [Migrated to React]

I previously made a static website with HTML and CSS to display my current work in photography, programming, and design. However, I wanted to elevate the site and showcase more of a skillset, so I migrated the site to react with plans to extend its functionality and take advantage of what react libraries have to offer. 

## What Worked Well

I feel confident in my knowledge of jsx and components, so it wasn't too much trouble setting those up. I also really enjoy styling, and took my time to make sure I really liked the final product I wanted. I also really enjoyed messing with packages like tsParticles and the timeline to better showcase my work history. 

## What Didn't

I had a bit of trouble deploying a vite app directly to pages, but once I found the documentation it was smooth sailing. A lot of photo carousel packages are also a bit buggy to implement, which was a frustrating part of the process. An ongoing issue is managing my photo library so it loads in faster. I think I will add smaller photo sizes in the future.
